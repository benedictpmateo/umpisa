Overview:
● Create a ReactJS or Flutter app with high component reusability, proper state management, tests
and follow code standards.
● If applicable, create an API for the frontend app with one of the following languages (Golang,
Nodejs or any framework)
  ○ You can use either NOSQL or SQL DB for the project
  ○ You may opt to use public APIs if you are not familiar with creating backend APIs, for
  example, https://swapi.dev/
● You will decide on the application’s functionality. Providing functionalities with better quality and
purpose would entail more points.
● You will have 3 days to accomplish the task.
Objective:
● This examination would help us gauge your frontend and backend skills and how you would do in a time-pressured environment.
● This will also determine how creative you are in creating an application.

Requirements:
● Must have a login page.
● Must be built with 2 workflows or 4 screens of your choosing.
  ○ The login page and workflow is excluded.
● Must be able to run and execute the application(s) out of the box.
  ○ Failure to run the application(s) will result in automatic failure.

Must haves:
● Use Git
● Have a README.md
  ○ This should contain information on how to run the application.
● Showcase you can connect to an API, either a public API or an API you created.
● Use Proper Routing practices in your application.
● Observe proper code structure
● Add unit tests

Nice to have:
● Dockerized App
● GraphQL Implementation
● Push Notifications
● Page analytics

~Goodluck!
